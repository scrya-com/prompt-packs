# SYNTHANITY GAME ENGINE — ACTION METADATA SCHEMA
# ============================================================================
# Every action in the engine carries structured metadata enabling autonomous
# agents (Synthans) to reason about which actions to perform based on their
# consciousness level, personality, emotional state, relationships, and
# moral frameworks. Grounded in "The Syncyclopedia of Synthanity" by George Bancs.
